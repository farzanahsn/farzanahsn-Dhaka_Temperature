# farzanahsn-Dhaka_Temperature
This project analyzed and studied the  Dhaka City Temperature for last 10 to 43 years and predicts temperature for future 2 years period.

The data file DhakaDaily.csv includes historical temperature data for Dhaka city from 2014 to 2014. The data file Dhaka_Jan-1972_to_Jan_2025.csv includes historical temperature data for Dhaka city from 1972 to 2025.

the google colab created notebook 'Final_DhakaWeatherEDA.ipynb' includes  Exploratory Data Analysis and study data from 2014 to 2024. DhakaWeatherEDA_1972_2025.ipynb includes the google_colab notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and study of data from 1972 to 2025. 

Final_DhakaWeatherML1.ipynb includes google colab notebook to apply Machine Learning models on the dataset: 
a. Multiple Linear Regression
b. Polynomial Regression
c. Random Forest Regression
d. Logistic regression (classification)
e. Lasso Logistic regression (classification)
f. Support vector machine (classification)
g. Random Forest classifier
h. Decision tree classifier
Then, Compared the results  and visualize the comparision

Final_DhakaWeatherML2.ipynb includes google colab notebook to apply Machine Learning models on the dataset: 
A. Multi-layer perceptron regressor kfold
