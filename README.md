# farzanahsn-Dhaka_Temperature
This project analyze Dhaka City Temperature for last 25 years and predicts temperature for future 2 years period.

file DhakaDaily.csv includes historical temperature data for daka city from 2014 to 2014. file Dhaka_Jan-1972_to_Jan_2025.csv includes historical temperature data for daka city from 1972 to 2025.

Final_DhakaWeatherEDA.ipynb includes the google_colab notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and study data from 2014 to 2024. DhakaWeatherEDA_1972_2025.ipynb includes the google_colab notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and study of data from 1972 to 2025. 

Final_DhakaWeatherML1.ipynb includes google colab notebook to apply Machine Learning models: 
a. Multiple Linear Regression
b. Polynomial Regression
c. Random Forest Regression
d. Logistic regression (classification)
e. Lasso Logistic regression (classification)
f. Support vector machine (classification)
g. Random Forest classifier
h. Decision tree classifier
Then Compare the results and visualize the comparision
